# Q: What will be the output of comparing these two strings?

s1 = "apple"
s2 = "banana"

# "apple" is not equal to "banana", therefore it is False
print(s1 == s2)

# "apple" is different from "banana", therefore it is True
print(s1 != s2)

# "apple" comes before "banana" lexicographically, therefore it is True
print(s1 < s2)
